## 1. Core Concepts of OSINT

**OSINT** involves collecting and analyzing publicly available information from a variety of sources to gain insights on a target. OSINT is commonly used in **cybersecurity**, **threat intelligence**, and **investigations**.

### **OSINT Workflow**
1. **Define Objectives:** Identify what information is needed and why.
2. **Identify Sources:** Decide which sources will likely contain the required information (social media, websites, public records, etc.).
3. **Collect Data:** Gather data from various OSINT sources.
4. **Analyze Data:** Assess the data for relevance, accuracy, and insights.
5. **Report Findings:** Document results, drawing conclusions and recommendations if needed.

### **Ethical and Legal Considerations**
- Only gather data from public sources.
- Respect privacy laws and avoid unauthorized access.
- Avoid information misuse and follow ethical guidelines, especially when OSINT is applied to cybersecurity or investigations.

## 2. Common OSINT Techniques

| **Technique**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Passive Reconnaissance** | Collect information without direct engagement with the target (e.g., social media scraping, WHOIS data). |
| **Active Reconnaissance**  | Interact with the target directly (e.g., port scanning, sending test requests). |
| **Social Media Profiling** | Analyze social media accounts for patterns, locations, connections, and activities. |
| **Metadata Analysis**      | Extract metadata from documents, images, and files to find information about authors, locations, and timestamps. |
| **Search Engine Dorking**  | Use advanced search operators to uncover hidden information on websites (e.g., Google Dorking). |
| **Public Record Search**   | Retrieve data from government and public records like business registrations, property records, and court filings. |
| **Geolocation and Mapping**| Use geographic data to determine physical locations of individuals or organizations. |
